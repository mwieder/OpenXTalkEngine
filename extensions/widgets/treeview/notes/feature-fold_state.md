# Properties

The tree view widget now has the ability to get and set the fold state.

One property has been added to achieve this option:
* **foldState**: array

The fold state array is structured as follows:

```
	[key1]
		["folded"]
		["array"]
			[subkey1]
				["folded"]
	[key2]
		["folded"]
```
