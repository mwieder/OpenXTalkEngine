# Marker styles

The markerStyles of the line graph can now be set to a return delimited
list of:

- circle
- filled circle
- square
- filled square
- diamond
- filled diamond

Setting the markerStyles to empty will cause the lines of the chart to
draw without markers and set the showLines of the chart to true.
