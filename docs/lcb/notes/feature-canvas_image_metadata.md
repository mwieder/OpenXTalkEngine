# LiveCode Builder Host Library
## Canvas library

New syntax has been added to enable getting image metadata and density
information.

The image 'metadata' property returns data associated with the image in the
form of an array.

The image 'density' property returns an images density in dots per inch (DPI).
This allows widgets to scale images appropriately for display.
