# LiveCode Builder Standard Library

## Foreign function interface

* When passing a Number to one of the foreign integer types (`LCInt`, `LCUInt`,
  `IntSize`, `UIntSize`), an error will be thrown if the value is outside the
  range of the requested type.

* The `IntSize` and `UIntSize` types can hold the full 64-bit integer range,
  however the maximum magnitude which is supported for converting to and from
  Number is 2^53. An error will be thrown for any conversions outside this
  range.

# [19214] Increase usable range of IntSize and UIntSize types
