# LiveCode Builder Language
## Bytecode Blocks

* bytecode can now be directly written in handlers using a bytecode block:

      bytecode
         register tTemp
         assign_constant tTemp, 1
      end bytecode

* for more details on what bytecode operations can be used see the LiveCode
  Builder Bytecode Reference

* bytecode blocks are not for general use and the current set of bytecode
  operations are subject to change
