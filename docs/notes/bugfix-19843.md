# revAvailableHandlers and revAvailableVariables now in all engines

The 'the [effective] revAvailableHandlers' and 'the revAvailableVariables'
properties are now available in both the IDE and Standalone engines.

Note: These properties are currently undocumented, and reserved for
IDE related uses. You are free to use in your own code, but their
semantics could change in any release.
