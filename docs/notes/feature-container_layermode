# New container layer mode

Container layer mode support has been added to the accelerated
rendering architecture.

The container layer mode only has an effect on unadorned groups
whose ancestors are also container layer mode unadorned groups.

A container layer mode group provides a container for static and
dynamic layers, allowing nested groups to also benefit from
being cached for fast re-rendering.

For more information, see the **layerMode** entry in the dictionary.
