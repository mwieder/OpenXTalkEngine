# Support for App Tracking Transparency

The Standalone Builder now includes a checkbox that adds support for App Tracking Transparency.
This is a requirement if your app collects user data that is shared among apps or websites.
Moreover, a text field is added, where you can provide the usage description string, i.e. the dialog 
text that will be presented to the user letting them know that their data will be shared.
